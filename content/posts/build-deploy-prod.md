## System is running

Hello everyone! This is my blog. I'm a grumpy mid-level/almost-but-not-there-yet-senior software developer. Like most people, I decided that my opinions are so important that the world should be blessed with them.

I would like to start this by making a confession: the real reason I'm doind this is because I'm in some sort of 'dev middle-life carrer crisis'. Yes, after many years in this business, I don't know why I do what I do. Not a clue! Actually, I do have some theories.

Some wise people suggested that writing to yourself is a good therapy method, so I decided to use a blog to try to find out exactly what is going on and maybe find a solution. Will see...
