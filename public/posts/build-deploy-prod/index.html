<p>Hello everyone! This is my blog. I&rsquo;m a grumpy mid-level/almost-but-not-there-yet-senior software developer. Like most people, I decided that my opinions are so important that the world should be blessed with them.</p>
<p>I would like to start this by making a confession: the real reason I&rsquo;m doind this is because I&rsquo;m in some sort of &lsquo;dev middle-life carrer crisis&rsquo;. Yes, after many years in this business, I don&rsquo;t know why I do what I do. Not a clue! Actually, I do have some theories.</p>
<p>Some wise people suggested that writing to yourself is a good therapy method, so I decided to use a blog to try to find out exactly what is going on and maybe find a solution. Will see&hellip;</p>
